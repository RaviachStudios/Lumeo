// Server-side leaderboard backend for Lumeo. Two jobs:
//
//  1. board_top maintenance (event-triggered). The 20-row top list is 100% of
//     the fixed leaderboard read cost. Instead of every client running six
//     top-N queries on warm-up, ONE doc per family holds all three difficulties'
//     top-N lists, and clients read one doc per family. These docs are written
//     ONLY here (Admin SDK bypasses rules; firestore.rules makes board_top
//     client-read-only), so the visible lists can't be forged. We update on a
//     score write, but GATE the write on "does this actually change the top-N?"
//     — so a submit that doesn't crack the top 20 costs one read and no write,
//     and there's no write-hotspot from the 99% of scores that change nothing.
//     Concurrency is handled by a transaction (two entrants at once can't lose
//     each other).
//
//  2. Daily standings (scheduled, once just after midnight UTC). Reads the top
//     50 of each of yesterday's daily boards (only the top 50 earn coins),
//     credits each winner's wallet SERVER-SIDE, writes a receipt into
//     pending_daily_rewards on /users/{uid} for the client to show, then deletes
//     yesterday's daily rows. This removes the old per-open, per-player rank
//     reads (the heaviest read path) and makes the placement snapshot
//     authoritative at day-close. Idempotent via the last_daily_reward_date
//     high-watermark, so a retry (or an old client that still respects the same
//     watermark) never double-pays.
